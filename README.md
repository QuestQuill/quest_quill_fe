# QuestQuill - Front End 
## About
This app serves as a Dungeous and Dragons, Dungeon Master's Companion App and leverages the power of AI to create curated adventures for a DM and their party. 

This app is a one-stop-shop companion for a DM to create adventures for their party. Create towns with stories and characters that feel believable. Follow those stories into dungeons that are fully populated with loot and combat encounters (both of which can be randomly generated based on the theme and the partyâ€™s level). Using the power of AI lifts HOURS of work from the DM as they work to create a campaign. 

This is the front-end repository of this app. Please see [HERE](https://github.com/QuestQuill/quest_quill_api) for the backend repository.
